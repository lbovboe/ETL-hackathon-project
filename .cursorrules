# ETL Hackathon Project - Financial Data Pipeline

## Project Overview
This project builds an intelligent ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for financial data analysis. The system transforms scattered, multi-year financial records from various sources (card payments, bank transfers, e-commerce transactions) into structured, analyzable datasets.

## Project Goals
- Automate collection, cleaning, and transformation of financial data
- Enable analysis of spending trends and customer behavior
- Support evaluation of financial strategies and marketing policies
- Provide actionable insights for banks, fintech companies, and digital commerce platforms (Shopee, Grab, PayNow, etc.)
- Bridge the gap between raw financial data and actionable intelligence

## Target Use Cases
- Banks and financial institutions
- Fintech companies
- E-commerce platforms
- Digital payment services
- Customer engagement and personalization
- Financial planning and forecasting

## Technical Architecture
The project follows a standard ETL pipeline architecture:
1. **Extract**: Collect financial data from multiple sources
2. **Transform**: Clean, normalize, and enrich data
3. **Load**: Store processed data in structured formats for analysis

## Code Standards & Best Practices

### Data Engineering
- Write robust data validation and error handling
- Implement data quality checks at each pipeline stage
- Use appropriate data types for financial values (avoid floating point precision issues)
- Handle missing data gracefully
- Maintain data lineage and audit trails
- Consider data privacy and security (PII handling, encryption)

### Python Development
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for function parameters and returns
- Write modular, reusable code
- Implement comprehensive logging
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Use pandas for data manipulation
- Consider performance optimization for large datasets

### SQL Development
- Write clear, well-formatted queries
- Use appropriate indexes for performance
- Implement proper data normalization
- Add comments for complex queries
- Use transactions for data integrity

### Testing & Quality
- Write unit tests for transformation logic
- Validate data quality at each stage
- Test edge cases (null values, duplicates, invalid formats)
- Monitor pipeline performance and failures

### Documentation
- Document data schemas and field definitions
- Maintain README with setup instructions
- Document pipeline workflows and dependencies
- Include sample data formats and examples

## Project Structure
- `/data/` - Raw and processed data files
- `/notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for exploration and prototyping
- `/scripts/` - Python scripts for ETL pipeline components
- `/sql/` - SQL queries and database schemas

## Data Handling Considerations
- Financial data requires high accuracy (use Decimal for currency)
- Timestamps should be timezone-aware
- Handle multiple currencies appropriately
- Maintain transaction integrity
- Consider data retention policies
- Implement proper access controls

## Key Technologies
- Python for data processing
- Pandas for data manipulation
- SQL for data storage and querying
- Jupyter notebooks for analysis and visualization

## Security & Privacy
- Never commit actual financial data or PII
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Implement data anonymization for non-production environments
- Follow compliance requirements (GDPR, PCI-DSS, etc.)

## Performance Considerations
- Optimize for large datasets (millions of transactions)
- Use chunking for memory-efficient processing
- Implement incremental data loading
- Consider parallel processing for transformations
- Monitor resource usage and bottlenecks

## When Assisting with This Project
